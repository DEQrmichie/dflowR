#' Design Flow Calculation
#'
#' Function to find the design flow based on methodology used in U.S. EPA's [DFLOW program](https://www.epa.gov/ceam/dflow)
#' with a modification to account for missing flow data or days with zero flow.
#' If there are missing flow data in any particular water year, all data from that water year is not used.
#' This approach is [recommended by EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ceam/technical-support-dflow#xqy) (although not implemented in DFLOW 3.1)
#' and applied in USGS's [SWSTAT](https://water.usgs.gov/software/SWSTAT/) program.
#'
#' The methodology for this function is based on the equations contained in DFLOW user manual
#' as presented by Rossman (1999). Design flow is computed from the sample of lowest m-day
#' average flow for each defined year, where "m" is the user supplied flow averaging period.
#' The arithmetic averaging is used to calculate the m-day average flows. A log Pearson Type III
#' probability distribution is fitted to the annual minimum m-day flows. The design
#' flow is the value from the distribution whose probability of not being exceeded is 1/r where r
#' is the user-supplied return period.
#'
#' If a particular season is desired, set wystart and wyend arguments to correspond to the beginning
#' and ending dates of the season. The season does not have to span an entire year. Only flow records
#' that fall within the season will be used in the calculations.
